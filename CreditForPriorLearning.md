### Project Description:
Sam Houston State University (SHSU) has provided guidelines for the awarding of academic credit for work, life, or other non-collegiate learning experiences. These guidelines are ideal for situations where academic programs want to offer credit for bespoke experiences.

In some cases (e.g., SHSU Institute training), it may be advantageous for the Institute and SHSU academic programs to reach an agreement that formalizes and scales the credit a student would earn for their prior learnings. In these cases, the academic programs in collaboration with the Institute would follow defined steps.

### Goals:
- Define and institute a process regarding CPL when Institutes and SHSU academic programs partner.
- Develop an agreement between Institute and SHSU that speaks to all parties’ interests and responsibilities.
- Define testing parameters for awarding of credit.
- Develop a marketing campaign to recruit students.
- Detail enrollment processes for Institute students (non-credit) to become SHSU academic students (for credit students).

### Strategic Plan Alignment:
- Priority 1: Prioritize Student Success and Student Access
