### Project Description:
Students currently elect to provide access to their student records as permitted by FERPA, using several disparate methods:  
- Submitting paper FERPA release form per Financial Aid, 
- Granting access through the Banner Proxy Portal, and/or 
- Granting access through TouchNet. 

However, each of these mechanisms creates a disjointed and siloed experience for students and their authorized users. A single approach to managing FERPA authorizations is needed to improve user experience for both students and staff. 

### Project Goal: 
Use low-code tools to: 
- Design and implement a process to collect authorization for release of FERPA information from authenticated students. 
- Provide an interface for employees to search for and access FERPA authorization selections by SamID. 
- Provide an interface for employees to make a record of the specific information communicated to authorized users. 
- Maintain a history of FERPA authorizations by students for audit purposes. 

### Strategic Plan Alignment:
Priority 1: Prioritize Student Success and Student Access
