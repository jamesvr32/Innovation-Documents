### Porter's Five Forces

Porterâ€™s Five Forces is a strategic framework developed by renowned economist Michael E. Porter. It provides a structured analysis of competitive forces within an industry to assess its attractiveness and profitability. The five forces include the bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, the threat of new entrants, the threat of substitute products or services, and the intensity of competitive rivalry. This framework helps businesses and decision-makers understand the competitive landscape, identify potential threats and opportunities, and develop effective strategies to navigate the market successfully. By analyzing these forces, organizations can make informed decisions to maintain a competitive edge and thrive in their respective industries.
