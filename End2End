# SHSU End to End Testing Steps

## Overall Order of Operations

### Accounts (Not Person Accounts)

Records for the following record types need to be created via data uploads or integrations and then added as needed ongoing:
- Campus
- Education Partner
- Industry Partner
- University Department or College

These records need to be established before Learning Programs are created in the Academic Structure so the Departments and Colleges fields can look to them.

For Education Partner Accounts that are High Schools, the Territory and Bearkat Advantage fields need to be populated if applicable.

### Academic Structure
Records are imported via integrations from Banner for:
- Academic Year
- Academic Term
- Academic Sessions (Parts of Term)
- Learning Programs

These records need to be established before Individual Applications and Person Accounts can look to them.

A regular maintenance pattern is needed to create and inactivate these records.

### Person Accounts
All Person Accounts need the field of Person Account Type populated with one of these values:
- Suspect
- Prospect
- Student
- School Contact
- Industry Partner
- SHSU Employee
- Family
- Recommender

This field controls how the Page Layout appears.

Ways Person Accounts are created:
- Data Upload (purchased lists, external systems)
- RFI
- Gecko Sync
- Test Scores Submitted
- Manually
- Application Submission

Person Account Types of Suspect, Prospect, and Student have a Territory Assigned.

When other people are related, the reverse relationship appears on the Related Person Account.
